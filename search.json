The report should be as short as possible with only relevant material; avoid digression and do not mention ideas that were considered but discarded.\nPerhaps start with an outline (bulleted list) of take-home messages (conclusions, statistical advice); then an outline or bulleted list of items needed to support the take-home messages. If the ordering of sections is as given below, write an outline for each section and then convert to paragraphs. This should help to avoid tangential sentences (material not needed to support the statistical advice).\nThe format and most guidelines below are also good for term project reports, presentations, and research articles/reports.\nReports for regular clients: 4 to 6 pages; an appendix of several additional pages (e.g. sample R code) could be added if relevant."

State the statistical questions the client wants answered (or should want to have answered).\nProposed statistical methods and results.\n\nDescriptive tools: Suggest appropriate tables and figures for summarizing the data; include example figures relevant to the project (use simulated data if you have to)\nAnalytical techniques: Avoid using formulas to the maximal extent possible (supply relevant references instead); explain ideas along with an example and perhaps sample output relevant to the project\nAny statistically significant result should be supported with appropriate graphs or tables.\n\nConclusion. Summarize your recommendations.\nFurther reading. Include references that you know are at the level your client will understand.\nAppendix. If the client wants formulas and computer code, this is the best place to put it\n\n\n\nAdditional advice\n\nDon’t put lengthy computer code or output in the body of your report. If you want to provide some details on how to carry out the analysis you are recommending, put this in the appendix. Ideally, this would be in the software the client plans to use.\nDon’t refer the client to references for explanations or examples without having given your own.\nDo communicate clearly. Avoiding formulas and using relevant examples and figures to back up your explanations are probably the best way to ensure your client will understand your advice.\nDo not use too many digits in your report. Typically numerical output of statistical software requires truncation of the number of decimal places.\nThe captions of graphs and tables should be self-contained enough so that the meaning is clear without reading the body of the report.\nUnits of all variables should be included in summaries etc."

    "section": "Suggestions for Consulting Reports for Non-Statisticians",
    "text": "Suggestions for Consulting Reports for Non-Statisticians\n\nOverall style\n\nReport should be written to your client, so must use language your client can understand. Use plain English and avoid statistical technical terms, such as “generalized linear model” (better would be binary regression or count regression or ordinal regression depending on the response type) and “hierarchical model”.\nReport should focus on motivation, explanation and interpretation. Your client needs to understand (conceptually) the nature of the analyses you are suggesting/presenting, and it is most important to convey clearly what interpretations are possible based on your suggested analyses.\nSections should be organized to discuss simpler approaches first and more complicated approaches later, using the discussion of the simpler approaches to build up to the more complicated approaches. For example, for regression, could start with one predictor before multiple predictors.\nReport should not include verbatim copy of computer output (for example, R markdown is inappropriate except possibly in the appendix).\nReport should include only essential tables and figures (not everything that you produced from your code). Include only what is needed to support the advice/conclusions.\nNever say that an assumption or hypothesis has been verified. You can say that an assumption of statistical procedure can be assessed with some graphical method.\nIf assumptions about a statistical procedure are included, be precise in stating them without using notation. For example, for the paired-t procedure, saying “the data are assumed to be normally distributed” is imprecise; the precise assumption is that “differences of .. and .. are assumed to be normally distributed”\n\n\n\nAnalysis Strategies\n\nAlways carry out detailed exploratory analyses before any formal analyses.\nAvoid over-reliance on hypothesis testing; estimation via confidence intervals or out-of-sample assessment of prediction ability are much more informative.\nBe careful with pseudo-replication.\nFor statistical methodology, it is better to understand methods based on statistical theory from your previous courses. Avoid use of a search engine for a methodology to solve a problem. It is not acceptable to only provide R (or SAS/python) functions/code as advice for a client. Anything software must be backed up with brief explanations of the methodology in non-technical language. Because there are errors and unclear documentation in many R functions (including non-standard uses of lm(), glm(), anova() etc), when you are using an R function for the first time, please verify most of the output via direct coding of a few lines of R code. Note that output of maximum likelihood estimation can be verified via nlm() (nonlinear minimization function), with input of the negative log-likelihood.\nFor reference of statistical methodology to a client, provide a book reference rather than a web site.\nIf you plan to continue to do research in MSc or PhD program, you will be better prepared if you come up with your own ideas for statistical methods for different data situations and write your own code. That is, if you can develop and code existing methods on your own, this is a step to developing and coding new methods in original statistical research.\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Results\n\nBe very careful when discussing statistical inference based on observational data, when there is no randomization or sampling basis for carrying out the inference. To what population does the inference apply? Keep in mind that your inference is entirely model-based in such situations.\nYour summary section should include a frank and careful discussion of any concerns you may have about your recommended approaches to the client’s problem.\n\n\n\nProofreading and notation\n\nGeneral: Proofread your report very carefully for clarity of wording, optimal organization, and grammatical errors before you submit it for review. Use a spellchecker to check for spelling errors.\nAvoid abbreviations in text. If an abbreviation is needed, show the full term before the first occurrence of the abbreviation.\nIn this course, the word ‘data’ should be considered as plural for grammatical considerations. (The singular form in Latin is ‘datum’).\nIf necessary, information will be posted on correct use of mathematical notation without overloading symbols and abusing notation for functions and random variables."

UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious, spiritual and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available here.\n\n\nAcademic honesty and standards\nUBC Vancouver Statement\nAcademic honesty is essential to the continued functioning of the University of British Columbia as an institution of higher learning and research. All UBC students are expected to behave as honest and responsible members of an academic community. Breach of those expectations or failure to follow the appropriate policies, principles, rules, and guidelines of the University with respect to academic honesty may result in disciplinary action.\nFor the full statement, please see the 2020/21 Vancouver Academic Calendar\n\n\nAcademic Concessions\nThese are handled according to UBC policy. Please see\n\nUBC student services\nUBC Vancouver Academic Calendar\nFaculty of Science Concessions\n\n\n\nTake care of yourself\nCourse work at this level can be intense, and I encourage you to take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. I struggle with these issues too, and I try hard to set aside time for things that make me happy (cooking, playing/listening to music, exercise, going for walks).\nAll of us benefit from support during times of struggle. If you are having any problems or concerns, do not hesitate to speak with me. There are also many resources available on campus that can provide help and support. Asking for support sooner rather than later is almost always a good idea.\nIf you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support. UBC Counseling Services is here to help: call 604 822 3811 or visit their website. Consider also reaching out to a friend, faculty member, or family member you trust to help get you the support you need."
